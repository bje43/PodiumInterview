Review content: I went too mckaig and knew exactly what I was looking for but didn't know how the process was going too be. Adrian was recommended too me from a great friend and also I would hear mckaig over the radio and I wanted to see for myself. So I headed there a day before my purchase and talked about the car I was looking into purchasing and Adrian very professional polite an honest told me the ups and downs and did explain an lead me too the car that I have today finally purchased. He was very professional and great person too help me too choose out a car. Talked too me about the car told me the specs about it without any hesitation. He is the one too go to if you are looking into getting a new car. Great atmosphere there at mckaig and great people they have working with them there in all I greatly consider them top in their profession. I could give Adrian a score it would be 110% with a gold star explainging it all too me and working with me. Giving his time too help me with a purchase of my new car Thank you very much.

Review content: Pleasant experience for the whole transaction.  Sabrina went the extra mile to find the right pickup for me.  She is very knowledgeable about the inventory, terms, and product features.  Excellent attitude toward the dealership, products and the customer..  The whole transaction was a friendly, non pushy atmosphere.  I would go to McKaig first, the next time I want to purchase a Chevrolet.  I have visited other dealerships but the friendliness of McKaig  Chevrolet in Gladewater made the decisions easy.

Brittany let us know what was happening while we waited, what we needed, and how long they will keep our information. She was so patient and kind with my family and I. She really went above and beyond what was expected. It was the best experience that I've had at a dealership.

Review content: My experience with McKaig Chevrolet will always be remember as one of the greatest  moments  for looking for a vehicle.  From start to finish everyone was so helpful, friendly, Professional staff. All had made my experience a  very lasting impression.  No pressure,  non pushy and most of all willing to help see me get into a vehicle.  With me having some financial obstacles reflecting they went out of the way to find a lender that would work with me and my current situation and the results paid off. not only did I get approve,  but  I drove home in a brand new 2017  vehicle.  So if there  is hope for me  there is definitely hope for the  next person that is in need of a vehicle.  Don't let that stand in your way  Thanks Jason for helping me I appreciate you and I intend to purchase my next vehicle here as well.

Review content: McKaig was the first place I went to to buy my first car. I chose to come here after hearing an employee rave about how friendly and helpful they were in helping her find a car that would fit her budget. It was everything she told me it would be and more! Brittany was extremely helpful and did everything she could to find the right car within my budget. I've already recommended this place to all my friends and family, it's more than worth the 45 minute drive there to me. Never did I think buying a car would be so pleasant but McKaig and Brittany have shown me it can be!

Review content: This was both the first and last dealership I visited in my search for a vehicle. First because they had the best price on the vehicle I wanted check out. Last because the first visit went so well. In between I visited other dealerships in Tyler, but each one either did not have the vehicles I wanted to check or because the sales representatives were so high pressure that I left as quickly as possible. In the end I came back to McKaig to look at the first vehicle. I called and spoke again to Jason and arranged to come back later that evening. Life happens and I ran late. He stayed to meet me at 10 minutes to closing. I was able to test drive and really go over the vehicle again. I did decide I wanted the vehicle. We started the (usually) long process of haggling. Instead of it being a long back and forth, it was quick and easy. Then he and two other employees stayed until the deal was done. It was almost 10 pm before we finished and none of them complained. After the sale, I realized the the oil needed changing. I brought up to their attention and they changed it. It has been the easiest vehicle purchase I have ever made. Jason has followed up with me, but not intrusively.  Anyone in the market for a new or new to you vehicle, McKaig is the place to buy.

Review content: We were searching for a new vehicle and we went through the Team National Dealer Mall to find a Dealership. We made an appointment two days prior with the correct contact for buying through Team National and when we got there they gave us a different salesman but that he knew the process for the TN deal. Our experience with McKaig in Gladewater, TX started out great and we thought we were taken care of till a week later. McKaig called and told us to bring the car back because the deal was not final and that the contract was not valid. They informed us that WE had to call GMC Financial to finalize the contract and that they weren’t going to pay off the trade-in. (motorcycle) At this time we were informed that NO we didn’t get the Team National discount or the Veteran discount. We were told that we received the 20% discount that everyone receives walking through their door. When we signed the papers at the dealership we were told we were getting the TN, the Vet, and the 20% discount. When we received the call from McKaig we were told NO we were not given the TN or the Vet discount because McKaig doesn’t do all three it is what McKaig chooses in the end. The next day we were on the way to take the car back and retrieve our motorcycle (the trade-in) only to be informed that they didn’t know where our bike was and that the owner refused to speak with us. My husband did continue to the dealership and a salesman came out to Donny and informed him that the Dealership would try and locate the motorcycle and make this right.  From this point forward NO ONE at McKaig would take our calls or return messages and at this time Harley Davidson was still asking where the payoff of the bike was!!! We have informed the BBB of their ethics problem and also have starting working with an attorney on this matter. We will be informing the very large membership of Team National not to waste their time with McKaig Chevrolet Buick!

Review content: I was not picked off by a vulture the minute I got out of my car. I went in I was greeted warmly and directed to a sales associate. He then went over their Customer Bill of Rights. Which is exactly how everything went. It was a great car buying experience. They never tried to put me in a car they knew I would never qualify for instead they first figured out what I would qualify for with my trade and down payment and showed me the vehicles I could afford. It was wonderful. I love my new SUV. It has everything I was looking for and I can afford it!

Review content: Adrian Cortes was the nice gentlemen that help me when I went to look at a used suburban. He was very nice and told me everything I wanted to know about the truck while I was test driving it. When we returned to the dealership, I ask him what kind of payments would it be and the range sounded like something I could afford. He took my info and came back with payments that were very reasonable. I decided to buy the truck, so while I was filling out paper work and doing all those things , he was getting it wash and took it and put gas in it for me. I really like the friendly way things were done, not like most car dealers that are pushing to make a sale no matter what. I will most defiantly be recommending this dealership and Adrian Cortes.

Review content: Thank you for an awesome car purchasing experience.  Your employees were all so kind and seemed to care about our needs.  Adrian and Justin were very helpful and went out of their way to make sure all of our questions were answered and to get us the vehicle that we wanted not what they wants us to have.

My husband told Adrian and Justin that we have always wanted to do business with McKaig and now that we have had the opportunity and we would certainly recommend McKaig to others.

Review content: McKaig has always been able to work my service into their schedules in a timely manner.  I usually need a loaner car or I need to be taken to work, while leaving my auto for service.  They have always happily done this for me.  I work about 20 minutes away from the dealership. I had an "extensive" tune up completed on my car, but after picking it up on Friday evening, my engine light came on. Of course, it was a holiday weekend, so on Tuesday morning I arrived at the dealership, after calling ahead and by the end of the day, they had replaced a coil and got my car up and running, no charge.  Thank you, McKaig and John in the service department.

Review content: Well we did it again! Our 6th vehicle from McKaig has been purchased the 2nd one in less than a year! We traded our 2015 Traverse for a 2017 Equinox. I love my new vehicle. Mike Lambert, Sabrina Preiss and Jeriamy Shumacher, make quite the team! Once again we were treated like family all the while maintaining a professional attention to detail. That is quite a feat these days! Thanks again to a great team. As always Mike you rock! Sabrina you sure make the paper work fun,.. Could have stayed longer chatting and laughing!  What a team Ken and Mark have put together! :) If you are looking for a new vehicle go see Mike Lambert and tell them Belinda sent you! lol
